In programming field, I'm a total amateur. By education (and by heart) I am a biologist. I admire learning new skills and exploring the world. 
Currently I study bioinformatics and learn Python, but I look forward to new challenges. I believe IT world is the best choice for my future, 
because it is such a field where there is always something new to learn and you cannot stay in one place without developing new skills. 
C ++ is something totally new for me, but I am willing to learn and work as hard as it is needed to be a pro!
